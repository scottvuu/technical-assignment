### Main Screen Magic

The main screen, the Posts screen, is currently conjured with illusions from the `src/data.json` file.

## ✨ Enchanted Post Features

### Comment Conjuring

Only the initiated can cast comments. Cast your comments at level 1 (lv 1) or level 2 (lv 2).

### Editing and Deleting Enchantments

Should you be the comment sorcerer, hover over your creation to reveal the options icon (three dots) for magical editing or deletion.

### Comment Hierarchy Sorcery

Experience the magic of comment hierarchy—up to three levels: Parent > Children > Sub-Children. Replying to a Sub-Children comment keeps the magic at the same level.

### Mention Charms

When casting replies, the mentioned user's name is woven into the magic.

Please note, for simplicity and the user's mystical experience, nested levels are enchanted up to three. Enjoy the magic! ✨
